    It took a lot of time for me to discover what I am/like to be. 
    I believe the term "full stack" data scientist is the best term for it (as weird as it may sound)!

    I'm a Data Scientist with  data engineering skills who is fascinated by creating end-to-end projects, 
    explainable machine learning models, and predicting human behaviour.

    Most familiar languages and tools:

    1) Languages : Python, SQL\n
    2) WebScrapping: Selenium, BeatifulSoup\n
    3) Data Processing : Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, NLTK\n
    4) Modelling/Machine Learning : Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels\n
    5) Deep learning: Keras, Tensorflow\n
    6) NLP: NLTK, BERT\n
    7) Data Visualisation : Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair\n
    8) Business intelligence: Metabase, Google Data Studio, Power BI\n
    9) Monitoring experiments: MLFlow\n
    10) Deployment: FastAPI,Streamlit, Flask, Gradio, Docker
